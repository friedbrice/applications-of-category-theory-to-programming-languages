# applications-of-category-theory-to-programming-languages

Presentation and supporting code examples given at the Graduate Mathematics Seminar, Cal State Channel Islands, 2018-03-05.

_PDF available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d5m7fxs2xkld136/applications-of-category-theory-to-programming-languages.pdf?dl=0)._

_Build artifacts for code examples available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r2e3uxs1rarj2o5/applications-of-category-theory-to-programming-languages.zip?dl=0). (You'll need Java and Scala to run the examples.)_

**Note to Software Professionals:** This presentation is not a monad tutorial. This is a graduate-level talk targeted at mathematicians and computer scientists about programming language research. If you are a software practitioner and you'd like an introduction to monads, I suggest taking a structured approach that builds up to the concept incrementally. If you're interested in learning Haskell specifically, take a look at [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/); however, learning Haskell is not the key to understanding monads, and understanding monads is not the key to learning Haskell. You'll have much more success learning about monads in your Favorite Languageâ„¢ (they all have monads, these days) first.

**Note to Math Grad Students:** There aren't a lot of academic positions these days, and non-academic employment options in Mathematics depend heavily on your ability to program. This is not bad news, since if you can learn advanced Math, then you can certainly learn programming at the required level. The programming language that Mathematics grad students with no prior programming experience will find least bizzare is Haskell, and I highly recommend you take a look at [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/). If, on the other hand, you have a good amount of prior programming experience and feel like you have a decent handle on the methodology of programming in a specific language, I recommend simply going deeper into that language, especially if you have friends who use that language every day and can help you learn.

## Setup

To build the presentation and build and run the code examples, you need Java, Scala, and Latex distributions installed and configured on your system. You'll also need the command-line tool _Pandoc_.

**Mac (with Homebrew):**

```sh
brew update && brew upgrade
brew cask install java mactex
brew install scala pandoc
```

**Ubuntu:**

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo apt install default-jdk scala texlive-full pandoc
```

## Build Slideshow

From the `latex/` directory, run `./build.sh`. This will generate `presentation.pdf`.

## Build and Run Code Examples

From the `scala/` directory, run `./build.sh`. This will generate a cornucopia of class files.

Once the class files are built, you can run the various code examples by calling `scala` (again, from the `scala/` directory) with the name of the class whose `main` method you'd like to run:

```sh
scala OrdinaryPartiality
scala MonadicPartiality
scala OrdinaryIO
scala MonadicIO
```

## Build All

From the project root directory, run `./build.sh`. Build artifacts will be written to the `dist` directory.
